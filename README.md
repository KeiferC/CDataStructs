# C Data Structures

### Description
Customizable abstract, polymorphic C data structures for personal use. Just slowly implementing for fun.

### Implementation Details

|     Data Structure     |   Implementation Status   |
|:----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|         Vector         |         Complete          |
|          Stack         |          Waiting          |
|          Queue         |          Waiting          |
|          Heap          |          Waiting          |
|         Matrix         |          Waiting          |
|       Linked-List      |        In progress        |
|       Binary Tree      |          Waiting          |
|   Binary Search Tree   |          Waiting          |
|          Trie          |          Waiting          |
|          Graph         |          Waiting          |
|        Hashtable       |          Waiting          |

### Note
Largely based on the modules of David R. Hanson's _C Interfaces and Implementations_.

Work in progress.
